# Cardinal Chains

1 - Introduction
This project is based on the "Cardinal Chains" puzzle game, released in 2018 and developed by Daniel NORA.

It has been realized using C programming language with a graphical user interface where the player can create chains using the mouse.

2 - Presentation
"Cardinal Chains" is a minimalist puzzle game centering on the concept of non-decreasing sequences. Each puzzle begins with a monochrome grid of numbers and cells marked with an "x". Starting at these cells, you must link up numbers in non-decreasing order until the whole grid is filled with color. Difficulties and types of puzzles are varied, and there is no timer, nor a limited number of tries.

3 - Rules
In each level the player has a board with empty and full cells. The full cells are different numbers as well as starting points symbolized by "x". The goal is to go through all the numbers in ascending (or at least identical) order, from the starting points, by creating chains of directly adjacent numbers (no diagonals). Each cell can only be traveled once, so it is not possible to create intersections or overlaps. The levels can have one or more final cardinal chains, depending on the number of starting points.

4 - How to play
Download the project files and extract them to a directory of your choice. Then open an IDE of your choice supporting the langage C, open the download folder and click run button on the main.c file to open the GUI interface of the game. Click "Start" to play the levels.

Enjoy the game !
